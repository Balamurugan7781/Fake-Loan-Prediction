# Fake-Loan-Prediction
Implementing Various Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms and implementing it in a website using web development:

  * Data Preprocessing like removing and filling null values( mode for categorical and mean for continouos values in the dataset)
  * The algorithms implemented here are Naive Bayes( GaussianNB, BernoulliNB, MultinomialNB), Support Vector Classifiers (with GridSearchCV) , DecisionTree Classifier, Random Forestr Classifier.
  * Based on the best accuracy obtained, BernoulliNB is implemented. 
  * The website developed by keeping BernoulliNB as base model with the help of pickle files for dumping using'joblib'library.
